## Everything Old is New Again

This is the content of a presentation I gave at WilmingtonJS on Aug 21, 2018.
It is a [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) presentation.
(This repo contains `reveal.js` as a Git submodule.)

The main content is in `Closures.md`; reveal.js renders this Markdown
as a presentation as per `index.html`.
